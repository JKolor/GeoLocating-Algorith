# GeoLocating-Algorithm
This repository contains the code, along with the code description for my attempt at creating 2 algorithms which are able to predict where an image was taken using Deep Learning. 
There are two folders in this repository: "Application" and "GeoLocating-Models".
The "GeoLocating_Models" folder contains the implementaion of two Deep Learning Models:
- "1-image-integration-model" contains the code for the model which is a able to predict in which US state a single image has been taken.
- "4-image-integration-model" contains the code for the model which is able to predict in which US state, a 360 degree image split into 4 different images has been taken.
